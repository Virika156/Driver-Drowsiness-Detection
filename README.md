Studies show that driver drowsiness and distraction together contribute to nearly 40-50% of serious road accidents in India. So, I was driven to create an AI solution that can prevent such incidents across the country.

My solution is a mobile app that detects driver drowsiness or distraction using a phone camera. The phone will be mounted on a standard phone holder placed on the windshield at eye level. Using a MediaPipe model, the app tracks the driver's eye aspect ratio (EAR) and head angle in real time to classify them as Alert, Warning, or Drowsy/Distracted. If drowsiness or distraction is detected, a loud alarm sounds to help the driver regain focus and prevent potential accidents.

My target users are truck drivers, cab drivers, and anyone on long drives, as they are more prone to drowsiness or distraction. The app is ideal for them because it uses just a smartphone—no extra hardware or setup costs—and works without the internet, making it accessible, low-cost, and easy to use for drivers across India.
